# Movie Pipeline — MovieLens + OMDb ETL

## Overview
This project builds a small ETL pipeline that ingests MovieLens CSVs (`movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`), enriches movies with metadata from the OMDb API (director, plot, box office, released date, runtime), and loads the cleaned data into an SQLite database (`movies.db`) for analysis.
